> 16. Recommended: While on the Spotify web instance in Firefox, click on the hamburger menu in the top right corner of the browser and press "Add to home screen" - this transforms the website into a PWA (Priority Web Application) and gives you an easy access shortcut to the Spotify player. 
> 17. FINAL TIP: You can begin playing a song in the web interface and then open the Spotify app - it will let you play music there and control playback without any limitations.

* * *

> 18. SIDE NOTE: PWA's essentially allow running an entire app in your web browser.
> A good way of finding progressive web apps is through `store.app`
> The degree to which you can block ads varies depending on the app, but it is often times better than using the actual app - a PWA also uses less storage than installing a native app.
